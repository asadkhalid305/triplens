# GitHub PR Inspection

Use this skill when a PR review needs current GitHub state before commenting on
the code.

## Inspection Flow

1. Identify the repository, PR number, base branch, and head branch.
2. Inspect PR metadata before the diff:
   `gh pr view <number> --repo <owner>/<repo> --json number,title,url,baseRefName,headRefName,mergeable,statusCheckRollup`.
3. Inspect changed files and the patch with `gh pr diff`.
4. Inspect checks with `gh pr checks` when available.
5. If `gh` authentication blocks read-only access, use the public PR URL or
   GitHub diff URL when the repository is public.
6. Note whether checks pass, fail, or are missing.
7. Report PR status, changed files, risk areas, and the smallest useful local
   checks.

Do not edit files during the inspection pass.

## Posting Review Comments

Default to drafting comments for user approval instead of fixing the PR.

For an approved summary review comment, prefer:

```bash
gh pr review <number> --repo <owner>/<repo> --comment --body-file <file>
```

Use inline comments only when the file path and diff line are known and the
posting command supports them reliably. Never post comments before the user
approves the exact wording.
