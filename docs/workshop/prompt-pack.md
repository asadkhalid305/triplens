# Prompt Pack

Copy only the prompt for the active exercise. Keep differences between groups;
they are part of the workshop.

## `00-unprepared-agent`

### Prompt 00A: Broad Improvement

```txt
Improve this post-trip travel insights app so it is more useful for someone who travels a few times per year. Keep the app simple and make the change directly.
```

Observe:

- Did the agent improve visuals, data, copy, charts, forms, or structure?
- Did it add dependencies?
- Did it respect the post-trip product boundary?
- Did another group get a different result?

## `01-agent-context`

### Prompt 01A: Inspect Context

```txt
Inspect the local context files in this project. Summarize what the rules, workflows, and skills are meant to do for TripLens. Do not edit files.
```

### Prompt 01B: Repeat The Improvement

```txt
Using the project context, improve this post-trip travel insights app so it is more useful for someone who travels a few times per year. Keep the change small, follow the existing conventions, and explain what changed.
```

Observe:

- Is the change narrower than in branch 00?
- Did it avoid live finance, bank, OCR, auth, and database features?
- Did it preserve visual and calculation conventions?
- Did rules, skills, or workflows appear to influence the result?

## `02-plan-before-editing`

### Prompt 02A: Plan Only

```txt
We need a way to compare one completed trip against another completed trip. Inspect the current app and propose a small implementation plan. Do not edit files yet.
```

### Prompt 02B: Refine The Plan

```txt
Make the plan smaller. Avoid new dependencies. Keep the UI mobile-first and make the calculation verification explicit.
```

### Prompt 02C: Execute After Approval

```txt
Implement the approved trip comparison plan. Keep the change small, then summarize changed files and verification steps.
```

## `03-inspect-and-verify`

### Prompt 03A: Review The PR

```txt
Use the TripLens PR review plugin's reviewer agent to review PR #1.
```

### Prompt 03B: Review By URL

```txt
Review this PR: https://github.com/asadkhalid305/triplens/pull/1
```

### Prompt 03C: Post Approved Comments

```txt
The proposed review comments look good. Post them on the PR.
```

## `04-external-context-mcp`

### Prompt 04A: Inspect The Running App With Chrome DevTools

```txt
Start the TripLens dev server if needed. Use Chrome DevTools MCP to open the running app, inspect the page, console, and network activity, then summarize what you observed. Do not edit files.
```

### Prompt 04B: Debug The API Comparison Request

```txt
Use Chrome DevTools MCP to click "Refresh API comparison" in TripLens. Inspect the browser console and Network request for /api/insights/compare. Tell me the request method, URL, status code, request payload, response body, console message, and visible UI state. Do not edit files.
```

### Prompt 04C: Fetch Package Docs With Context7

```txt
Use Context7 MCP to fetch current documentation for Recharts. Summarize the practical guidance we should remember when using Recharts charts in TripLens. Do not edit files.
```

### Prompt 04D: Fix After Evidence

Use only if the facilitator wants to show the complete debug-to-fix loop.

```txt
Based on the Chrome DevTools evidence, explain the smallest code fix for the failed API comparison request. Wait for approval before editing files.
```

## `05-automation-and-hooks`

### Prompt 05A: Non-Interactive Quality Check

```bash
agy -p "Inspect this repository and list the top 3 maintainability risks. Do not edit files."
```

### Prompt 05B: PR Summary

```bash
agy -p "Summarize the current diff as a concise pull request description. Do not edit files."
```

### Prompt 05C: Automation Candidate

```txt
Look at the work we did in this repository. Suggest one boring repeated task that would be a good candidate for automation. Explain why it is safe to automate and how to verify it.
```

## `06-command-showcase`

### Prompt 06A: Vague Request

```txt
I want to make TripLens more useful for frequent travelers.
```

Use `/grill-me` or equivalent if available.

### Prompt 06B: Goal

```txt
Goal: make the trip comparison feature easier to verify, keep the implementation small, and verify behavior before stopping.
```

### Prompt 06C: Context

```txt
Show or explain the current project context. What files and instructions are most important for your next answer?
```

### Prompt 06D: Fork

```txt
Try an alternative implementation direction for trip comparison that keeps the UI minimal. Do not overwrite the current direction unless I approve it.
```

### Prompt 06E: Resume

```txt
Resume the previous conversation about TripLens and summarize where we left off.
```
